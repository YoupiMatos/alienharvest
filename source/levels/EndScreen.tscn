text = "After surviving the encounter with the alien and selling the egg, our protagonist got extremely rich.
He started an industrial farm of Bitonios, harvesting thousands of eggs per day.
Unfortunately, the Space Creature Wellbeing Association did a surprise visit and concluded that the Bitonio's well being was not respected.
The protagonist served 3 years of prison and was forced to sell all of his assets.

It was later discovered that Bitonios are able to communicate via telepathy, and that they were indicating to the protagonist that a great trasure was on the planet. Unfortunately, the protagonist's space suit blocked the telepathy all along.
THE END

Thanks for playing!"
